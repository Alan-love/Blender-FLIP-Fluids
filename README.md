# FLIP Fluids

The **FLIP Fluids addon** is a tool that helps you set up, run, and render liquid simulation effects. Our custom built fluid engine is based around the popular FLIP simulation technique that is also found in other professional tools such as Houdini, Phoenix FD, Bifrost, and Mantaflow. The FLIP Fluids engine has been in constant development for over four years with a large focus on tightly integrating the simulator into Blender as an addon. It just feels like a native Blender tool!

With our reputation for delivering high quality software and outstanding customer support, the FLIP Fluids addon is one of the best selling products on the Blender Market.

## Getting the FLIP Fluids Addon

You may purchase the **FLIP Fluids** addon on the [Blender Market](https://www.blendermarket.com/products/flipfluids). Purchasing a license entitles you to to full FLIP Fluids feature set and content, tool support, and helps ensure the continued development of the addon. Thanks to the amazing support of the Blender community, we have been able to further develop the addon on a full-time basis for over two years!

#### Getting Support

You can get support for the **FLIP Fluids** addon by reading the [documentation and wiki](https://github.com/rlguy/Blender-FLIP-Fluids-Beta/wiki) or through the Blender Market messaging system. Support is granted to all customers whom have purchased a license.

## License

This program uses multiple licenses. See the files ```LICENSE_GPLv3.md```, ```LICENSE_MIT.md```, and ```LICENSE_Standard_Royalty_Free.md``` for license details. In General:

- The Blender addon code is licensed under the GPL.
- The fluid engine is licensed under the MIT license.
- Some addon content will be using a Standard Royalty Free license. This license may cover content such as media, artwork, and data. This content will only be included within the paid addon and will not be available on the GitHub project page. The addon is still completely usable without this content.

Source code files will state their license at the top of the file. Assets will include a license file and information in their containing directory.

### Source Code availability

The FLIP Fluids addon is developed in our team's own private repository. Due to licensing restrictions, the project source contained in the public GitHub repository cannot contain the royalty-free content (See [LICENSE_Standard_Royalty_Free.md](LICENSE_Standard_Royalty_Free.md)) of the Blender Market product and cannot contain features that depend upon the royalty-free content. The public repository will often not be up-to-date with the private development repository. The full source code including all features and royalty-free content is distributed with the Blender Market product.

### Source Code Dependencies

There are three dependencies to build this program:

1. A compiler that supports C++11
2. (optional) OpenCL headers (can be found at khronos.org)
3. (optional) An OpenCL SDK specific to your GPU vender (AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, etc.)

_WARNING: Compilation using MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler) is not supported. Building with MSVC will result in errors, performance issues, and incorrect simulation behaviour._

### Building

This program uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) utility to generate the appropriate solution, project, or Makefiles for your system. The following commands can be executed in the root directory of the project to generate a build system for your machine:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
```

The first line creates a new directory named ```build``` and changes the working directory to the newly created build directory. The second line runs the CMake utility and passes it the parent directory which contains the ```CMakeLists.txt``` file.

The type of build system generated by CMake can be specified with the ```-G [generator]``` parameter. For example:

```
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
```

will generate Makefiles for the MinGW compiler which can then be built using the [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) utility with the command ```make```. A list of CMake generators can be found [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).

Once successfully built, the addon and python bindings will be located in the ```build/bl_flip_fluids/``` directory.
